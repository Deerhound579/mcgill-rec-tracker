<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![banner](images/banner.jpg)

In the period of online learning, we rely heavily on lecture recordings . The
current LRS doesn't remember our viewing history, and of course, we can't resume
from where we left off. Our course load is already heavy, we need an easy way to
track our recordings.

This tool tracks you viewing history with a progress bar under each video. And
you can resume from where you left.

Never fear for refreshing the page by accident again.

<!-- Reminder -->

## Note

It only starts updating your progress when the video is ready to play(spinner
has gone). Also, the update happens every second, so it's not 100% accurate.
These may be improved in the future.
