<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![banner](./images/banner.jpg)

In the period of online learning, we rely heavily on lecture recordings. The
current LRS doesn't remember our viewing history, and of course, we can't resume
from where we left off. Our course load is already heavy, we need an easy way to
manage our recordings.

This tool remembers you viewing history with a progress bar under each video.
And you can resume from where you left.

Never fear for refreshing the page by accident again.
